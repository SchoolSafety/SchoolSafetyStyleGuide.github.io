# Content Style Guide

## What is a content style guide?

The content style guide is intended for designers, content creators, and copywriters who are tasked with writing user interface (UI) copy or informational materials for schoolsafety.gov. A content style guide helps designers and content creators create content that's consistent, easy to understand, and meets our audience's needs. It provides high-level principles for content writing and requirements for grammar, sentence structure, and word choice.

## Content Principles

- Content provided by different agencies should feel like it was written by one person. Use the same voice, tone, and sentence structures throughout the site. 
- Content should comply with federal [Plain Language Standards](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/)
- Avoid complex technical jargon or terms that only specific audiences would understand. Avoid government or agency jargon that isn't well-understood by the general public. Content should be understandable by everyone-- especially people are new to school safety planning. 
- Make content web friendly by avoiding PDF documents. Strive to use HTML for all web content so that information is mobile-friendly and acessible. 

## Writing Rules and Style 

- Use first person tense throughout the site.
- Use [active voice](https://content-guide.18f.gov/active-voice/), which supports brevity and helps the reader identify the subject of the sentence. 
- Start each “option for consideration”, “strategies to consider”, or “best practices” with an action verb so directives feel actionable and are easily skimmable in list form. 
  - Example: “Identify or hire a person….”, “Provide training…”, “Review the responsibilities…”
- Make content skimmable by using bullet points or paragraph breaks where necessary. 
- Avoid using directional language that requires the reader to see the layout or design of the page. 
  - Example: “Select from the options on the right sidebar.” or “Click here to view the foundational elements”
- Spell out acronyms when they are first referenced on a page. 
  - Ex: School Emergency Operations Plan (school EOP)

## Content Types

- Buttons
  - Use sentence case
  - Start button text with an action verb. 
- Headers and subheaders
  - Use title case
- Link text
  - Avoid ambiguous link text, like “click here” whenever possible.

# UI Style Guide 
 
## What is a user interface (UI) style guide?
