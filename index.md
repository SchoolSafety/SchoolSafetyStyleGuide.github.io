# SchoolSafety.gov Style Guides

**Getting Started**

This site provides guidelines to help you create consistent, accessible, and user-friendly content and designs for SchoolSafety.gov. This guide is for product owners, product managers, designers, developers, or other individuals who are working on SchoolSafety.gov.

**Maintenance** 

Guidelines and style guides should be accessible to all team members and contributors. Team members should also be able to update guidelines and design documentation as SchoolSafety.gov evolves. For that reason, these guidelines are published in a public-facing GitHub repo that contains markdown files where content is stored.
