# UI Style Guide 
 
## What is a user interface (UI) style guide?
 
A UI style guide documents the UI styles used on SchoolSafety.gov. It ensures that future designers can onboard quickly and create designs that are consistent with the current look and feel of the site. 

Examples include
- Defines typography and font weights
- Defines color pallette and usage
 
SchoolSafety.gov uses design components from the the [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), and the USWDS evolves over time. See the [USWDS site](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/) for the latest componets and guidance for their use. 

For an example of a UI style guide, see 18F's [UI Style Guide.](https://18f.gsa.gov/styleguide/)
