# Visual Identity/Brand Guidelines

## What are visual identity (or brand) guidelines?
Brand or visual identity guidelines provide guidance on how to use logos and brand assets on SchoolSafety.gov. They ensure that assets associated with SchoolSafety.gov are consistent, recognizable, and trustworthy. They also help prevent misspellings, errors, and incorrect usage of brand assets. Guidelines also provide team members with easy-to-access assets for generating promotional materials or continued design work.

Examples include:

* Defines logo usage outside of SchoolSafety.gov and how to use logos, like on social media, brochures, or promotions.
* Downloadable logos in preferred formats
* Guidance on brand name (SchoolSafety.gov versus schoolsafety.gov)
* For an example of visual identify, see [18F's Brand Standards](https://brand.18f.gov/).
